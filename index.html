  <section id="about">
    <h2>About AgroIndoor System</h2>
    <p>AgroIndoor is an innovative product by Group 10 that uses AI to monitor and optimize the state of plants grown in hydroponic systems. The system uses AI to monitor plant species, lighting, water, and pH levels to provide real-time updates on the plant's status, estimated time of harvesting, and yield rate. Our application includes a user-friendly interface that displays the plant's status in percentage form and provides notifications for when it's time to harvest. With AgroIndoor, even beginner home farmers can enjoy the benefits of growing their crops indoors.</p>
    <p>Indoor farming is an emerging space, but most of the available systems in the market are quite expensive due to temperature control and lack control of the plant's status. To improve this and make it more cost-effective, the AgroIndoor system is used outdoors to match the outdoor temperature. Although this means the choice of plants is regionally locked, our smart system contains a camera that detects the type of plant being used and sets the lighting and watering needs, adjusted according to the growth of the plant, and displayed in real-time on our user-friendly application.</p>
